# Product Info API

Displays a list of products or a list of a single product. This application starts on port 5003. Note: none of the data used in these results are real. They are auto-generated fake data.

There are two api calls available, if you start this docker container you should be able to see results from these two sample URLs:

## Get all products
- (GET) http://localhost:5003/products

## Get a single product
- (GET) http://localhost:5003/product/1001

# Build the Docker Container
To build and run the docker container locally, you can use the `kill-tag-run.sh` script. This script will start the container on `http://127.0.0.1:5003`.

### NOTE:
For testing purposes you will have to build this docker container locally and reference it manually because it has not been published. A simple nodejs example is here: https://git.target.com/grok/case_studies/blob/master/OnlineRetailStorefrontSolutions/UISolutions/docker-compose.yml
